# Disclaimer Regarding This Project
Just because I have mirrored a project by another person, this **does not mean** in anyway, shape, or form that I agree or support the views of this project or even the person who made it, I have simply mirrored it for historical reasons as I have an interest in digital preservation. Over the years I have taken the time in archiving many items, many of witch can be seen [on my Internet Archive user page](https://archive.org/details/@14jammar). Following this, just because I have mirrored a project, this also does not mean that the author endorses me or my work.

If you are reading this and are wondering why exactly [that this disclaimer](https://github.com/DynTylluan/disclaimer) is inside of this project, it is simply here as a blanket way for getting out of trouble if myself or the project owner gets into hot water in some way, just in case. This is a standard document that is in all of [my GitHub](https://github.com/DynTylluan/) mirrors and does not automatically mean that the project owner is a bad person or to be untrusted.

You are welcome to delete this file, as it will not effect the main part of the project in anyway.
